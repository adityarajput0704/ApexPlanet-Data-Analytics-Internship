# ApexPlanet Data Analytics Internship

This repository documents my work completed as part of the **ApexPlanet Data Analytics Internship**. The internship is structured into multiple tasks, each designed to build practical skills in data analysis, business intelligence, visualization, and data-driven storytelling.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow, starting from raw data understanding and cleaning, progressing through exploratory analysis and SQL-based insights, and culminating in dashboard design and business-focused reporting.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by task, with each task containing its own detailed report, code, and outputs.
